This big, winter-inspired beer is a whopping 10.0% alcohol and is a step into the deep end for the relatively new, BC brewery. The Apex Barleywine pours as a copper coloured beer with two fingers of dense and lacing head. An aroma of an lightly oaked, barrel aged barley wine comes with a slight metallic tone and an alcohol kick making for a big and strong winter brew. A big body kicks off the flavour with a strong oak flavour along side an intense bitterness. A roasted, almost burnt flavour adds to the oaky body and hop bitterness to give a deep and intense flavour profile. The oak in this beer is subtle but still apparent  A slight sharpness in that earthy tone comes from the Cabernet Franc bottles used in the aging process. The Apex Barleywine is not overly boozy but is still a very intense beer. This is a great beer to warm you by a winters fire or sip on a cold winter evening with friends.",

The aroma is light with notes of citrus and pine along with a light booziness. Rather hop forward on the nose, tasting the Apex it has a big body and starts things off in the flavour with that piney, citrus from the nose. Not overly bitter, the flavour is quite hoppy and has a distinct malty character that comes out mid-way through the tasting. A bitterness builds along the lingering pine character and finishes with a warming, lightly boozy tone. The Double Pilsner is a rare style in BC and is more often referred to as an Imperial Pilsner. This is a nice representation of the style with a bit more hop character than is typical for such a brew.",

From the Bomber bottle the Cinder Ale pours a clear amber colour with two fingers of tight and lacing head. From this beer comes a mid-sweet aroma of caramel and beech-wood smoke. The smokiness is rather strong but light enough to let the caramel notes sneak through. On the tongue the Cinder Ale is crisp and fresh with a fairly light body. The flavour is smoke heavy with a crisp and light sweetness in the beginning. As the flavour progresses the caramel tones diminish and leave way for a bitter-smoke, dry finish. The Cinder Ale is a rather smokey Altbier with a touch of sweetness and a crispness in the body.

As the head disperses an aroma of light malt, grass, citrus and pine with a hint of tropical fruit hits the nose in a fresh and fairly light way. The beer is clearly fresh hopped and packs a bit of a punch but the sessionability factor plays an even keel and makes this a beer that is both light and at the same time hoppy. Tasting the East Van Smash it has a fairly light body to it and right off the bat a malty tone hits the palate in conjunction with a citrus, grassy and fruity flavour.

With two fingers of dense and lacing head the Tam OShanter smells rich and creamy with notes of toasted malt, caramel, toffee and a vanilla like smoothness. Tasting the beer it is smooth like butter with a creamy texture along side a rather bubbly character. The flavour is rich and toasty with a caramel sweetness and a slighty burnt toffee bitterness. The Tam OShanter is quite smooth overall but the burnt tones add a contrasting sharpness to the flavour. This beer is a classically styled Scotch ale but turns things up with the kettle caramelization that adds mroe to the already flavourful brew. This is a delicious beer through and through.

From the bomber bottle this beer is a crisp, golden colour and has a finger and a half of lightly lacing head. The aroma is of earthy pine bitterness that is iconic of a euro-style hop. The malt character adds a light breadiness to the aroma with a mellow back-sweetness. The flavour too is iconically Euro with a slight twist. The Ariana hop is front and centre with a mellow pine character along side the earthy bitternss that came on the nose. There is also a touch of grapefruit and vanilla smoothness that comes through with mellow sweetness. The Ariana hop gives this beer a classic flavour but with an added twist that is quite flavourful and enjoyable.",

The aroma is tart with a strong briny citrus character and what smells to be passion fruit. The label states that the fruit notes come from actual fruit but there is no ingredient list found on the bottle to confirm our suspicions (dont tell the CFIA). Tasting the beer there is a mellow sourness to the flavour that leads into a wheat, fruit mid section. The fruit isnt overpowering but gives a clean and fruity flavour to the slightly salty brew. Most similar to a Berliner Weisse, the Fun Times is a unique and tasty session fruit beer.",

The fresh hop tones are not as powerful as some other fresh hop beers but balance well with the bitter hop flavour and malt tones.

With two fingers of head this beer has an aroma of pine and citrus with light pineapple fruit notes. It is a blend of traditional hop tones and a light, fruit infusion. The flavour is relatively malty and has a moderate hop bitterness. The combination of fruit and pine tones comes through with strength and leads into a bitter, very dry finish. Adding to the dryness is the body which has a slight powderyness to it on the tongue. This is a balanced and big-hopped IPA that offers both tradition and newer-minded hop flavours in a single package.",

The body is rather thin for the style with a strong coffee and bitter-chocolate flavour that hits the palate hard. As the cocoa bitterness mellows a light hopped bitterness joins the ensemble in a fairly rich way. This leads up to a very dry, fairly bitter finish. The body of the Postmark Dry Irish Stout may be light but the flavour is quite big considering a mellow 4.5% alcohol rating. The Postmark Dry Irish Stout is light on the tongue but big in flavour making it a rather tasty and enjoyable beer.",

    "beer_descr": "With summer comes the refreshing brews of fruit and the Postmark Brewing Company has brewed us a Raspberry Lemon Zest Hefeweizen. From the bomber bottle this summer inspired beer pours as a cloudy amber colour with a touch of red from the raspberries adding a peach like hue to the beer. Topped with two fingers of dense and lightly lacing head this beer smells fresh with German wheat, crisp with lemon-citrus notes and lightly sweet and sour with the raspberry tones. The flavour is big with raspberry notes but is not overly sweet. The mild sweetness builds with a fresh and crisp lemon flavour along side. The wheat tones add a smoothness to the body and the raspberry flavour continues to build. Sweetness does come into play later on in the flavour but not in an overly intense way. They building fruit-sugar may make the beer a bit less sessionable but it is quite enjoyable. Grab a bottle to share with a friend and you will not be disappointed with the Postmark Raspberry Lemon Zest Hefe.",

From the bomber bottle the Saisonella pours as a golden-straw colour with three thick fingers of lightly lacing head. A floral aroma of wheat and citrus fruit makes for a light, yet complex saison aroma. The body is relatively thin with a big carbonation component. The flavour consists of a solid wheat tone, a citrus-floral aspect and a defined yeast-note that adds a light funk, or as Postmark puts it frisky flavour to the concoction. The Saisonella is sessionable and light for a Saison but adds a unique and fairly complex flavour profile for an enjoyable and flavourful craft beer experience.",

The bubbly head settles moderately quick leaving light lacing on the sides of the glass. Through the head comes notes of vanilla, caramel and toasted malts. The smell forecasts a relatively light but smooth and creamy winter ale. The flavour starts off light and creamy but quickly builds into a full bodied English style strong ale. The middle of this beer has notes of toffee and toasted malts but any vanilla-like smoothness is masked but the bigger toffee flavours, winter spice and slight boozyness. The finish has a bop bitterness, light, toasted sweetness and a slight booze flavour left on the palate. This beer has a bigger and bolder flavour profile than expected but that hit has a great balance of dark flavours, winter spice warmth and hop bitterness. The Auld Nick should be on your wish list for this coming holiday  and it will likely fit well in a stocking!",

There is a pine-hop bitterness that coincides with the fresh scent of cucumber that is unique, intriguing and a little odd. The flavour is actually quite strong with cucumber as well along side a moderate hop bitterness and minimal sweetness. If you are looking for typical this is backwards and upside down but if you are interested in something refreshing, unique and a little off the deep-end the Birra Fresca is actually fairly nice.

The aroma is fruity with strong tropical tones of pineapple, mango and green apple. Tasting the beer it has a big body with creaminess to it. Tones of pineapple and apple come up front with a distinct sweetness and mellow bitterness that builds toward the finish. When you hear milkshake you may expect something very thick but this is more a fruit-forward, mellow IPA with a bit more body than is typical. Brewed using apple puree and lactose there is also an added sweetness and green apple flavour that is unique and quite tasty. This is a very enjoyable, new-age styled IPA.",

We Say Die!) this ale pours a copper-brown colour topped with two fingers of head. The head settles at a moderate pace leaving lace traces climbing up the glass from the beer surface. The aroma in this beer is tantalizing; toasted malt and caramel tones come through in the nose along side a fruity-floral flavour, hop bitterness and rye spice. The balance of sweet, spice and bitterness smells wonderful and forecasts a delicious brew. The flavour starts off with the toasted malt and caramel sweetness at the front of the mouth. Once this initial impression passes the rye takes charge. A balance of bitter-spice comes from the back of the tongue sourced from the hop and rye ingredients. If you ever struggled to define what Rye tastes like in a beer this is a great example of bold rye flavour. The dry finish leaves the palate on a bitter note and almost-rye bread like flavour. If you dont like rye you may struggle with this beer but as far as rye ales or even more specifically Rye-IPAs go, this is bang on and yet another amazing beer to come out of the CBC Radio 3 Canadian Band Beer Series.",

We've since solved the mystery, the Plague spread rapidly due to unsanitary conditions such as stagnant water, thus making beer one of the only safe things to drink. In honour of those pioneering plague fighters we brew our mighty Black Plague Stout. A behemoth of near Imperial proportions, this dry Irish style stout is sure to convert even the most devoted drinkers of Ireland's most famous export. We start with Canadian two row barley, followed by loads of roast barley and oats, a light addition of Pacific Northwest Columbus hops and finish it off with some fresh liquorice root and decadent dark cocoa for a little chocolaty mouth feel. Brewed in small batches (even by our micro brewing standards), the result is a smooth, rich, roasty and always fresh stout sure to cure what ale's ya. This once seasonal favourite is available year round for you thirsty hoards looking to fend off the plague of boring beer.",

The Highland Scottish Ale is a creamy, nutty, malty, Loch Ness Monster of an amber ale; chocked full of rich roast barley, hearty peated malt, and fortifying flaked barley. While the subtlety of Willamette hops keep this beer keenly aware that it's made in the grey mists of Vancouver, this delightfully smooth ale is perfect for fending off the damp chills of the moors of Scotland.",

Starting with premium Canadian two row barley, pure clean West Coast water and finished with mounds of Magnum, Lublin and Junga hops. The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness.",
